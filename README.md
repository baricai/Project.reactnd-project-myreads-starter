# FEND- Project-MyReads App

This project is about organizing an electronic bookshelf of books currently reading, that want to read, and already read.
This initial code comes with a pre-set template that Udacity provides with static code, the goal is to provide a dynamic code and functionality by refactoring the static code. We are dividing this project into Book Shelf, the List of Books, the how to move the menu, and the Search Books, we have added functionality by providing dynamic JS code with React design to each of the js files.
